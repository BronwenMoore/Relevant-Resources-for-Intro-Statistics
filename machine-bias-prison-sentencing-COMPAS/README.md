## Title

The original data base and more details can be found at [this propublica github](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis).  I deleted some columns that were duplicates and also columns with no data.  There are some remaining columns that are not explained in the methodology article (such as "start," "end" and "event."), and there are some columns that seem as though they could be eliminated, but that information actually humanizes the data set. For my purposes, the only columns of data I would need are as follows:  sex, age, age_cat, race, c_charge_degree, is_recid, r_charge_degree, is_violent_recid, decile_score, score_text, v_decile_score, v_score_text, and two_year_recid.  However, another professor might also be interested in this data for other activities, so I did not delete the other columns.
